  Hi, Welcome to the journey of Guerilla Uburbanism. We'll create a new kind of living method, living above the garage (ADU), move anytime we want (Dynamic).
  The site is in Utah, in rder to solve the pressure caused by rising housing prices on low-income families, and promote the rise of the rental housing economy as well.
  
  
  Home: 
	If the home is solid, then the person is the liquid, injecting vitality into the home, and the home is the most powerful container and refuge for the patrons. 
	Home is the response of a small society: people pursue benefits, avoid harm, allow themselves to meet their basic physiological needs, stay away from noisy places, give their families a sense of belonging, and refuge.

Client: the program works for an Accessory Dwelling Unit (ADU), composed of 6 different family: divorced family, senior couple, a person without a job, low-income family, homeless, veterinarian. Each of members could keep a pet. There is also a stray dog shelter there.

A Hypothetic Site: A n Accessory Dwelling Unit (ADU)

Flexibility: Increase the sell-on or re-let value of a building.
  
	High Thermal Stability
