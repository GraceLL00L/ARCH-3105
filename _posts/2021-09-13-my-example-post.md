  Hi, Welcome to the journey of Guerilla Uburbanism. We'll create a new kind of living method, living above the garage (ADU), move anytime we want (Dynamic).
  The site is in Utah, in rder to solve the pressure caused by rising housing prices on low-income families, and promote the rise of the rental housing economy as well.
