It is Grace, from Zhejiang, my chinese name is Yixuan Lin. And I major in Architecture in Michael Graves College at Wenzhou-Kean University. I loves traveling since I like to explore different cuisines, and I've been to Singapore, Paris, Kuala Lumpur and so on. But I like Shanghai most, where holds various exhibitions and I can meet different people. Due to the situation of COVID-19, I choose to stay alone at home, trying to draw of different type, including illustration and comics.

Welcome to visit my website about projects what I've done in 2021 Fall studio.
